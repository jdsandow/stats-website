    "text": "Headlines\n\nJust 2% of popular single-player, narrative video games released for the PlayStation 4 were completed by a majority of their players\nThe Last of Us Part II was the most completed video game (58%)\nTypically, only 25% of a video game’s players would see the narrative through to completion\nThere is no correlation between the length of a video game, or how well acclaimed it is, and overall completion rates\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nBroadly speaking there are two types of video game: those designed in an open-ended manner to keep you playing for as long as possible (e.g., arcade games like Pacman, online experiences like Fortnite), and games that provide a definite end goal to reach - typically, but not always, having the player follow a narrative (e.g., Super Mario Bros, Uncharted). For games that fall into the second category, a significant metric must be ‘how many people were engaged enough with the work to see it through to the end’, and this is what will be explored here.\nThe games included will be limited in the following ways:\n\nThey will need to be focused on single-player experiences with a definitive end goal\n\n\nRead more\n\nAlthough this will be objective to an extent, e.g., while most sports games do not have identifiable end points some - arguably - do. E.g., Crash Team Racing has a narrative that sees you competing in a racing competition and ‘beating’ a final boss. Beating the end goal of the main narrative will count as ‘completing’ the game - post-game content (e.g., DLC, collect-a-thons) will be ignored.\n\nThey will need to have been released on the PlayStation 4\n\n\nRead more\n\nThis will mostly limit the games to ones that have been out for a while, giving most players enough time to complete.\n\nThey will need to have been popular\n\n\nRead more\n\nThere’s no single, objective list so the games included will be a combination of those listed on Wikipedia as the best-selling titles (acknowleding that this list is reliant on publisher statements or third-party research), games that made it onto the PlayStation’s Greatest Hits range (although just because a game was not included in the range does not mean it did not sell well, and vice versa), and games listed as having the highest number of owners on PSNProfiles (although there is an element of self-selection about this list).\n\nThey need to have a trophy that obviously marks completion of the game\n\n\nRead more\n\nI will be ascertaining game completion through the percentage of a game’s players who have achieved the end game ‘trophy’. As there is no standard way of denoting this, it was a largely manual process (helped out with some Python code) and relied on my own research and subjective judgement.\n\n\n\n\nMost completed video games\nJust three games out of the popular video games analysed here were completed by a majority of their players: The Last of Us Part II (58%), Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (57%) and Yakuza Kiwami 2 (53%)(Table 1). Two things obviously link these titles: the first is that they are all sequels in popular franchises. This is likely to impact the completion rate as, for example, people who fail to engage with Yakuza Kiwami’s style are unlikely to progress to the second installment, so the playerbase is already self-selecting. (The first Yakuza Kiwami only has a 19% completion rate.) The second commonality is that they are all highly story-driven, with Last of Us and Uncharted having recently inspired uninteractive takes (i.e., a TV series and a film) on their narratives, indicating an appeal for these games beyond their gameplay elements.\nWhile most of these titles are clearly narrative-driven (including one - Detroit: Become Human that is close to simply being an interactive film), Marvel’s Spider-Man, Tomb Raider and Assassin’s Creed 2 are all identified by the Internet Game Database (IGDB) as either sandbox or open world games, so it’s a testament to these game’s narratives that players engaged with their main stories as much as they did.\nThe tenth most-completed popular title, Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 is a fighting game, but one with a specific story mode that seems quite narratively dense.\nTable 1 Popular PS4 games with the highest completion rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGame Title\nCompletion %\n\n\n\n\n1\nThe Last of Us Part II\n57.9\n\n\n2\nUncharted 2: Among Thieves Remastered\n56.8\n\n\n3\nYakuza Kiwami 2\n52.7\n\n\n4\nMarvel's Spider-Man\n49.0\n\n\n5\nGod of War\n46.3\n\n\n6\nTomb Raider\n46.3\n\n\n7\nUncharted: The Lost Legacy\n45.5\n\n\n8\nDetroit: Become Human\n45.1\n\n\n9\nAssassin's Creed 2\n44.4\n\n\n10\nNaruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4\n43.9\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s the typical completion rate for a popular video game?\nAs discussed, only three (or 2%) of the popular PS4 video games analysed here were completed by a majority of their players. The median completion rate is just 25%, with 43 (35%) of analysed video games being completed by between 20% and 30% of their players.\nFigure 1\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nIs there a link with length and completion rate?\nNo.\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nIs there a link with critic/player acclaim?\nMaybe\n\n\n                                                \n\n\n\n\nTable with complete list of video games\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nThis is the init_notebook_mode cell from ITables v2.2.5\n(you should not see this message - is your notebook trusted?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      Game Title\n      Completion %\n      Genres\n      Themes\n      Main story length (hrs)\n      Metacritic score\n      Metacritic user score\n    \n  \n\n\n    \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n    \n    \n   \n    \n      \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n    \n  \n        \n    \n      \n  \n        \n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n\n            \n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n\n\nLoading ITables v2.2.5 from the init_notebook_mode cell...\n(need help?)"

    "text": "Cinema attendance by deprivation index\nThe survey includes a measure of deprivation, the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), which is a composite measure of deprivation based on income, employment, health, education, crime, and living environment. Respondents’ postcodes are used to derive their LSOA (Lower layer Super Output Area, i.e., their immediate local area) and then assign them to this index. The index is represented by deciles, with 1 being the least deprived and 10 the most deprived, there are roughly equal numbers of people in each decile (between 9% and 11%). As seen in the following figure, there is a clear link between cinema attendance and deprivation, and it is even more linear than the relationship between cinema attendance and life satisfaction. At every step except for one, the more deprived an area you live in, the less likely you are to have been to the cinema in the last year.\nFigure 4 Cinema attendance by index of multiple deprivation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables = CARTS1_004 In the last 12 months which of the following events have you attended in person in England : a cinema screening of a film or movie and emdidc19 Index of Multiple Deprivation Download data"

    "text": "Life satisfaction by deprivation index\nNow that we know both life satisfaction and deprivation are good indicators for cinema attendance, we should look at the relationship between these factors. Conducting a Pearson’s Chi-squared test on the two variables reveals that there is a statistically significant relationship between life satisfaction and deprivation (p&lt;0.001). Looking at the residuals reveals that the effect is most obviously observed amongst people with low life satisfaction, as can be seen in Figure 3 which shows a roughly linear relationship between the level of deprivation and the proportion of people with low life satisfaction. However, this is not necessarily a rebuttal to the adage of ‘money doesn’t buy you happiness’. At the other end of the scale, the percentages of people with ‘very high’ life satisfaction are much closer together across the deprivation groups, with a range between 24% and 20% (although this lowest figure is still the amongst most deprived group). (You can look at this yourself by changing the filter in the below figure.)\nFigure 5 Life satisfaction by deprivation index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables = WELLB1 Overall how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? and emdidc19 Index of Multiple Deprivation Download data"

    "text": "Cinema attendance by life satisfaction and deprivation\nAs has been shown, to have a greater understanding of the relationship between cinema attendance and life satisfaction, we need to untangle the affects of deprivation. Table 1 clearly illustrates that the link between cinema attendance and life satisfaction transcends deprivation. In every single deprivation decile, from the most deprived to the least deprived, you are most likely to not be a cinema-goer if you have low life satisfaction. As previously mentioned, people are most likely to be cinema-goers not if they have very high life satisfaction, but rather if they merely have ‘high’ life satisfaction, and this also finds itself replicated in every single deprivation decile. Regardless of these consistencies, even if you have the ideal ‘high’ life satisfaction, if you live in the most deprived areas you are still less likely to have been to the cinema than a person with ‘low’ life satisfaction living in the most affluent areas.\nTable 1 Percentage of cinema-goers by life satisfaction and deprivation index\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables = CARTS1_004 In the last 12 months which of the following events have you attended in person in England : a cinema screening of a film or movie,WELLB1 Overall how satisfied are you with your life nowadays? and emdidc19 Index of Multiple Deprivation Download data"
